# Master Mind
A C++20 implementation of the classic 1970s game of [Master Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

## Description
I wacked up this game on [GodBolt](https://godbolt.org), and will be extending it gradually to learn about C++20.
The codemaker-side of the game is done, and I will probably get into writing a (semi-intellegent/non-stupud) solver, the codebreaker, as well.
